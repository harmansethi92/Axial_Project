Terraform

After my research and study in terraform for a day I would like to summarize that:

1.Terraform is a good orchestration tool with Infrastructure as code approach.
2.Terraform has a "planning" step where it generates an execution plan before execution.
3.Terraform focuses on the higher-level abstraction of the datacenter and associated services, without sacrificing the ability to use configuration management tools to do what they do best.
4. The terraform modules are pretty easy to read and write.
5. It has a good integration with other tools and platforms

Few Issues I figured out:
1.You can write anything in your Terraform config and it will accept it as a valid plan.
For example size of server "1000Zillion bytes" or Ubuntu 24.4 got accepted in the terraform plan stage
2.The docs for Terraform cover only the basics. For anything beyond that you have to look elsewhere


I believe that Terraform could be combined with Configuration Management tools such as Ansible, Chef, Puppet etc. This would be a good combination to deploy configurations to servers through Configuration Management tools and Provision those with Terraform.
